            <h3>Sweet Chilli Shrimp & Cabbage Stir-Fry</h3>
            <p>
                Falling into a stir-fry rut with the same veggie + sauce combo each week? We’ve got you covered. This
                version features garlicky ground pork, which is simmered in a sweet, savory, and spicy blend of soy
                glaze, ponzu, Thai chili sauce, and rice wine vinegar. It’s tossed with tender sautéed cabbage, then
                spooned over jasmine rice and garnished with crispy fried onions and fresh cilantro. The best part? It’s
                ready in just 20 minutes—now that’s what we call a winning dinner.<br>
